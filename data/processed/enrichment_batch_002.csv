Westing. They could become millionaires, depending on how they played the game. The not-quite-perfect heirs were paired, and each pair was given $10,000 and a set of clues (no two sets of clues were alike). All they had to do was find the answer, but the answer to what? The Westing game was tricky and dangerous, but the heirs played on, through blizzards and burglaries and bombs bursting in air. And one of them won! With her own special blend of intricacy, humor, and upside-down perceptions, Ellen Raskin has entangled a remarkable cast of characters in a puzzle-knotted, word-twisting plot. She then deftly unravels it again in a surprising (but fair) and highly satisfying ending. - Back cover.

Taylor,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12632397-L.jpg,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL40867W,"Set in Mississippi at the height of the Depression, it is the story of one family's struggle to maintain their integrity, pride, and independence. It is a story of physical survival, but more important, it is a story of the survival of the human spirit. And, too, it is Cassie's story -- Cassie Logan, an independent girl raised by a family for whom independence is primary, a family determined not to relinquish their humanity simply because they are Black. Cassie has grown up protected, grown up strong, and so far grown up unaware that any white person could force her to be untrue to herself, could consider her inferior and treat her accordingly. It took the events of one turbulent year -- the year of the night riders and the burnings, the year a white girl humiliated Cassie in public simply because she was Black -- to show Cassie why the land meant so much, why having a place of their own where they answered to no one permitted the Logans the luxuries of pride and courage their sharecropper neighbors couldn't afford and their white neighbors couldn't allow. Richly characterized, powerfully told, Mildred Taylor's novel is unforgettable. The Logans' story is at times warm and humorous, at times terrifying. It is a story of courage and love and pride, the story of one family's passionate determination not to be beaten down. -- Back cover.

""Please look after this bear, thank you."" It is these words, written on the label round his neck, which make the Brown family decide to take the small brown bear home with them. They meet him on Paddington Station; he had travelled by himself all the way from Peru, with only a jar of his favourite marmalade to keep him going. The Browns soon find that life with their little friend is going to be very unusual indeed!

Now for the first time, five novels about the adventures of Paddington are published together in this delightful omnibus.

Charming, enterprising, and always fun, this lovable, trouble-prone bear has friends in many countries and this unique edition will no doubt win him many more.

Book 1: *A Bear Called Paddington*
Mr. and Mrs. Brown first met Paddington, a most endearing bear from Darkest Peru on a railway platform in London. From the very first night when he attempted his first bath and ended up nearly flooding the house, Paddington was seldom far from imminent disaster. Jonathan and Judy were delighted with this havoc and even Mr. and Mrs. Brown had to admit that life seemed to be more filled with adventure when there was a bear in the house.

Book 2: *More About Paddington*
Paddington Bear becomes a celebrity when he takes portraits of the Brown family with a very old camera. Thanks to the unique results, a local shop puts the photos on display. And that's just the first adventure this extraordinary bear finds himself in. From wallpapering to mystery-solving, Paddington does it all with the sense of wonder and playful charm that readers have come to love.

Book 3: *Paddington Helps Out*
That bear is back again, and in this new edition of Paddington Helps Out, his attraction for near disaster is as magnetic as ever. Who but Paddington would set out to cook dumplings only to find himself chased from the kitchen by something so nasty only his resourceful friend Mr. Gruber can rescue him? And who else could get away with sawing his neighbor’s kitchen table in two or flooding the launderette? These and other riotous adventures all find their way into Paddington’s scrapbook and make for another delightful book starring this beloved bear from Darkest Peru.

Book 5: *Paddington at Large*
There’ll always be an England, but the old place has never been quite the same since the Brown children came across a small lost bear in London’s Paddington Station. Whether tinkering with the neighbor’s lawn mower or experimenting in the kitchen, Paddington has a knack for finding trouble.

Book 6: *Paddington Marches On*
Paddington tries his paw as a chimney sweep, washes barrels in a marmalade factory, and frightens the wits out of the visitors to Madame Tussaud's Wax Work Museum.","A Bear Called Paddington (Paddington, #1)",Michael Bond,"{""llm_analysis"": {""age_range"": ""6-8"", ""reading_category"": ""Beginning Readers (6-8)"", ""confidence"": 0.9, ""source"": ""gpt_analysis""}}",True,"{""age_range"": ""6-8"", ""reading_category"": ""Beginning Readers (6-8)"", ""confidence"": 0.9, ""source"": ""llm_analysis""}",A family takes in a small brown bear named Paddington who traveled all the way from Peru to London.
