Their idyllic summer is at first spoiled by a guest, a skinny, bespectacled ""sissy"" of a city boy, who at first dislikes ""the Five""(as they are called throughout the book), but slowly grows to like and accept them, and the feeling is mutual. The Five and the boy learn a lot about each other, as they teach him how to have fun and be a normal kid. As a reader, I hated to see the summer end almost as much as the Five and their new friend when they have to return home. It may seem politically incorrect to some of today's readers as to the depiction of African-Americans, but the Five, even though just children (the oldest is 14) have been raised to treat all people, black and white, with the dignity and respect they deserve. I recommend it to anyone of any age who wants to go back to a simpler time, or who just wants to have a good time reading. (P.S.--by ""evocative of time and place,"" I mean that it is set in the state of Virginia in the early years of the last century, and some of the older characters still remember the War Between the States.) The chapters where the Five are traveling by train from New York to Virginia (with a stop in Washington D.C. along the way) are particullarly entertaining, as is author Anna Rose Wright's descriptions of the farm, its surroundings and its people.

This classic is perfect for both young readers and lifelong fans.

""Once there was a tree...and she loved a little boy.""

So begins a story of unforgettable perception, beautifully written and illustrated by the gifted and versatile Shel Silverstein. This moving parable for all ages offers a touching interpretation of the gift of giving and a serene acceptance of another's capacity to love in return.

Every day the boy would come to the tree to eat her apples, swing from her branches, or slide down her trunk...and the tree was happy. But as the boy grew older he began to want more from the tree, and the tree gave and gave and gave. This is a tender story, touched with sadness, aglow with consolation.

The Giving Tree is a meaningful gift for milestone events such as graduations, birthdays, and baby showers.

Shel Silverstein's incomparable career as a bestselling children's book author and illustrator began with Lafcadio, the Lion Who Shot Back. He is also the creator of picture books including A Giraffe and a Half, Who Wants a Cheap Rhinoceros?, The Missing Piece, The Missing Piece Meets the Big O, and the perennial favorite The Giving Tree, and of classic poetry collections such as Where the Sidewalk Ends, A Light in the Attic, Falling Up, Every Thing On It, Don't Bump the Glump!, and Runny Babbit plus Runny Babbit Returns.",The Giving Tree,Shel Silverstein,"{""title_author_patterns"": {""age_range"": ""6-12"", ""category"": ""Intermediate Readers"", ""source"": ""author_pattern"", ""confidence"": 0.6}, ""description_enhanced"": {""reading_category"": ""Early Readers"", ""age_range"": ""3-6"", ""source"": ""description_series"", ""confidence"": 0.7}}",True,"{""reading_category"": ""Early Readers"", ""age_range"": ""3-6"", ""source"": ""description_series"", ""confidence"": 0.7}","A touching story about a tree and a boy, showcasing the gift of giving and the capacity to love.
