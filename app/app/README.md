## Model Performance
- **Lexile Prediction**: 27.9 MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- **Category Classification**: 95.2% accuracy
- **Cross-validation**: Consistent performance across folds
- **Tiered System**: 94-98% accuracy depending on confidence tier

## Customization

### Adding New Authors
Update the `author_stats` dictionary in `flask_backend.py` with:
- Book count
- Average Lexile level  
- Standard deviation
- Primary age category

### Expanding Book Database
Modify the `SAMPLE_BOOKS` dictionary in `flask_backend.py` to add more book recommendations.

### Model Updates
To use newly trained models:
1. Update `MODEL_TIMESTAMP` in `config.py`
2. Copy new model files to `app/models/`
3. Restart the application

## Production Deployment

### Using Gunicorn
```bash
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
```

### Environment Variables
- `FLASK_ENV=production`
- `SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key`
- `MODEL_TIMESTAMP=your-model-timestamp`

## Troubleshooting

### Models Not Loading
- Check that model files exist in `app/models/`
- Verify the timestamp matches your trained models
- Ensure all required dependencies are installed

### Prediction Errors
- Verify input data format
- Check server logs for detailed error messages
- Test with known working book examples

## Support
Built using your trained ML models from the reading level assignment strategy. 
For issues, check the Flask logs and ensure all model files are properly copied.
